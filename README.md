# info200finalProject: Educational Opportunities And Achieving Your Dreams

_By Cameron Baird, Mark Mirador, Sam Long, Ruiheng Zhang_

This project was completed as part of the INFO 201 course at the University of Washington in 2019. The work concerns the relations between educational opportunities and one's ability to achieve his/her dreams. We use R as well as several libraries (dplyr, Shiny, etc.) to achieve this analysis.
