       But is that really true?! Do things like your race, gender, economic status determine your ability
       to fulfill your youthful dreams? Are these trends changing? Our presentation seeks to examine the role 
       education plays in your ability to achieve even the most lofty of ambitions. 
       Specifically, we will be homing in on Astronauts to see what types of universities they attended. 
       This will allow us to target details such as whether the school is private or not, how much financial aid 
       is available, if many successful astronauts trend to come from particular schools, etc. In doing so, we 
       hope to expose certain biases that often go unnoticed in society, to help ensure a more equitable future 
       for us all."),
